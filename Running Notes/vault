==================

* Ansible Vault is a feature of ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles.

* ansible-vault create vault1.yaml
* ansible-vault view vault1.yaml
* ansible-vault edit vault1.yaml
* ansible-vault encrypt vault1.yaml
* ansible-vault decrypt vault1.yaml

=============================================================

* create a file git_clone.yaml
* to pass the credential from the vault, create a file
  --- ansible-vault create vault1.yaml
 * Now the vault file in the git_clone yaml file.
 * Now run the file using playbook command
  --- ansible-playbook git_clone.yaml --ask-vault-password
